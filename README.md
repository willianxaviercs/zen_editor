An simple text editor for C/C++ programmers, written in a subset of C++.

The main purpose of the project is getting proficiency in the language.

The editor is based on some of the old editors lie cygnused, with mark style editing and smooth text scrolling (not yet implemented).

The project is mainly written in C with a few features of C++, like default arguments, but the are no classes, templates and the std library.
